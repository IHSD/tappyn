      <uib-accordion-group heading="What do I do with the ad brief?">
        You use your imagination to create something YOU'd love to see. 
      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading="What is an ad handover?">
        When a company chooses a submission, that winner will immediately be notified and paid before the company receives your chosen advertisement.
      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading="Do I have to own the photos that I submit to contests?">
      Absolutely. You must have ownership of all content that you submit to contests. Content that is copied or sourced from another owner will be removed, and the account owner will be suspended.
      </uib-accordion-group> 
      <uib-accordion-group heading="What kind of photos can I submit?">
      As long as it's your own work, be as creative as you want! Selfies, landscapes, animals, sports, etc. You name it. Try to tailor your photo to the company that launched the contest, and include a picture of the product/app if available to increase your chances of winning.
      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading="What kind of photos am I not allowed to submit?">
      You may not post violent, nude, partially nude, discriminatory, unlawful, infringing, hateful, pornographic or sexually suggestive photos. Content that falls under these categories will be removed, and the account owner will be suspended. 
      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading="Will other users be able to see my photos that I submit?">
      Yup, everyone's submissions are viewable in that contest's submission feed. There's no need to be shy though. All types of creativity is encouraged here at Tappyn, and chances are that other users are going to love what you submit!
      </uib-accordion-group>
       <uib-accordion-group heading="What is a payout and how do I request one?">
       A payout is when you've won cash and you want to move it from our site to your pocket.
      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading="What payment methods are available?">
       Our default payout method is integrated into your account! Just input your account info, and your winnings can be directly deposited into the account of your choosing. If you’re an international user, just contact us through squad@tappyn.com or on the website, and we’ll arrange a PayPal payout method.
      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading="How do I know I'll get paid?">
        A winner is guaranteed for every contest! On the off chance that a company doesn’t choose a submission within 48 hours, the submission with the most votes will be paid $50, so it’s important to share your submission with your friends to gain more votes.
      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading="When do I sign the Copyright Transfer Agreement?">
        If you're like us, we’re not a fan of paperwork, so we’ve saved you some time and have included it in our Terms of Service that are agreed to during your sign-up. We’ve taken care of the legal process, so when you win, you only have to focus on what you’re going to do with your winnings!
      </uib-accordion-group>
   </uib-accordion>   
    <uib-accordion class='col-sm-6 col-xs-12 content-padding'>
      <uib-accordion-group heading="What is the upvoting system used for?">
        The voting system is used to gain Tappyn points (which can then be used for exclusive contests), increase the spotlight on your submission for companies to see, and help choose a winning submission in the case when a company doesn’t choose a submission within 48 hours of the contests ending.
      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading="Why is my ad not getting upvoted?">
        Feel free to share your own submission, so you’ll get a little help from your friends. Or maybe you had a rough morning. Maybe you're not in your prime on a Tuesday. No sweat - there's plenty of room for multiple at bats. 
      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading='Do up-votes influence the winning submission?'>
       The more up-votes that your submission has can make it jump out to each company when they’re analyzing all of the submissions. It’s ultimately up to the company that is hosting the contest to decide on the winning ad, but gathering up-votes from sharing and other users can significantly increase your chances of being chosen, and on the rare occasion where a company doesn’t choose a submission within 48 hours, the submission with the highest votes will be paid!
      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading="What are Tappyn Points and how do I use them?">
         Tappyn Points can be redeemed for exclusive access to contests. The system is not live just yet, but you can start gaining points now, and we'll notify you as soon as your points can be redeemed!
      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading='How do I get Tappyn Points?'>
          You can increase your Tappyn points by submitting to a contest, up-voting other submissions that you like, sharing your own submission, and of course, winning a contest. Winning a contest will earn you the most points, but you can still earn tons of points by up-voting other submissions that you like too!
      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading='Why should I share my submission?'>
          Bring your own squad on board, and boost your submission to the top voted spot!
      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading="What does the number 30 mean?">
        Only 30 submissions per contest. It keeps your chances of winning high and anymore than that isn't as easy on the eyes.
      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading="How will I know if I win?">
        You'll get a killer e-mail and it will show up on your account dashboard.
      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading="How many contests can I enter?">
        As many as you can handle. 
      </uib-accordion-group>
