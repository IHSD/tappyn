      <uib-accordion-group heading="What is Tappyn?">
        	Tappyn pays you to write short ads based on stuff you like. It works like a contest but only 49 other entries are allowed per contest. Each ad only takes 90 seconds to make and winners are awarded cash immediately after they are chosen. You can also get rewarded if others like your submission and upvote it.
      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading="What is an ad contest?">
        Contests are launched when companies need ads their audiences love. That's where you come in.
      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading="How do I join the party?">
       Sign in so that we can know what kind of contests you'll like and start writing away.
      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading="When does each party end?">
        You have 7 days from the time the contests launches to when it closes.
      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading="What do I do with the ad brief?">
        You use your imagination to create something YOU'd love to see. 
      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading="How do I find contests I like?">
        Tell us a little bit about you and we'll propose some options. You can also segment contests by industry.
      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading="What is an ad handover?">
        When a company has declared a winner for their contest, you'll sign our Ad Transfer Agreement and request your $$$.
      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading="How do I know I'll get paid?">
        If companies don't like any of the ads they receive, no problem. We'll pay the highest voted submission out of our own pocket.
      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading="When do I sign the Copyright Transfer Agreement?">
        As soon as you win a contest.
      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading="Why is my ad not getting upvoted?">
        Maybe you had a rough morning. Maybe your not in your prime on a Tuesday. No sweat - there's plenty of room for multiple at bats. 
      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading='Do up-votes influence the winning submission?'>
        The more up-votes that your submission has can make it jump out to each company when they’re analyzing all of the submissions. It’s ultimately up to the company that is hosting the contest to decide on the winning ad, but gathering up-votes from sharing and other users can significantly increase your chances of being chosen.
      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading="What is a payout and how do I request one?">
       A payout is when you've won cash and you want to move it from our site to your pocket.

      <uib-accordion-group heading="Which payment do we use?">
       We connect with all major credits.
      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading="What are points and how do I use them?">

      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading='How do I get Tappyn Points?'>
          You can increase your Tappyn points by submitting to a contest, up-voting other submissions that you like, sharing your own submission, and of course, winning a contest.
      </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading="What does the number 50 mean?">
        Only 50 submissions per contest. It keeps your chances of winning high and anymore than that isn't as easy on the eyes.
