## Server directory structure

The server file structure for the application is generated by Deployer

```shell
.
+-- var
|   +-- www
|   |   +-- tappyn
|   |   |   +--release      # Temp folder for new release
|   |   |   +--releases     # Holds past X releases
|   |   |   +--current      # Currently deployed repo
|   |   |   +--shared       # File that persist between releases

```

The release, releases, and current directories do not require any editing.
The virtual host for Apache is mapped to /var/www/tappyn/current/public/.

Inside of the shared directory, we store all of our config, logs, and cache files
```shell
.
+-- shared
|   +-- application
|   |   +-- v1
|   |   |   +-- logs
|   |   |   +-- cache
    +-- config
|   |   +-- v1
|   |   |   +-- {{ENVIRONMENT}} # All config files reside here
|   |   +-- phinx.yml
|   |   +-- config.js

```
