              	Tappyn pays you create short photo ads that only require an original photo and less than 2 minutes of your time to make. Each campaign works like a 7 day contest that pays out $85 to its winner, and only 29 other entires are allowed per campaign. Whether you're here to earn extra money, get your work recognized, or just having fun, Tappyn's community is changing how the world views advertisements.
            </uib-accordion-group>
            <uib-accordion-group heading="What is a campaign?">
              Campaigns are hosted by cool, new companies willing to pay an immediate $85 for a digital ad created by you. They are capped at 30 ad submissions and end after 7 days or if they reach their cap limit. At the close of the campaign, the hosting company chooses its favorite ad, and the creator of that winning ad is instantly paid. Other members of Tappyn can up-vote your submission, bringing it to the top of the campaign feed for the company to see. Submit to as many campaigns as you'd like!
            </uib-accordion-group>
            <uib-accordion-group heading="What does tapped mean?">
              When an ad gets tapped, it's essentially the same thing as being purchased, and the creator of that ad gets immediately paid!

                 It's 100% free to join Tappyn. Either sign in with your email or through Facebook. If you choose the email sign up option, you'll immediately be sent a verification link. Once you're verified, you're ready to go! Be sure to read our <a href='/guide'>helpful submission guide</a> before creating your first ad.
                </uib-accordion-group>
                <uib-accordion-group heading="How do I use a company's ad brief in a campaign? ">
                  On the left side of every campaign, an informational ad brief can be found which gives you important insight into creating the right ad. Personalized ads are almost always tapped before generic ads, so be sure to read about the company and what makes them different. Also, pay special attention to what they are looking for in an ad. Companies often explain in detail what type of ad they are more likely to love. It also won't hurt to check out their website, which is linked in the brief, to get a comprehensive sense of their branding. Remember, personalized ads almost always get tapped!
                </uib-accordion-group>
                <uib-accordion-group heading='How can I improve my chances of a company buying my ad?'>
                  First, under no circumstance should you upload photos that aren't your original work. (That includes free for use photos) They'll be removed immediately by our moderators. Second, read our <a href='/guide'>helpful ad creation guide</a>! You'll thank us later.
                </uib-accordion-group>
                <uib-accordion-group heading="When do the campaigns end?">
                  Campaigns end either 7 days after they are launched or when 30 ads have been submitted.﻿
                </uib-accordion-group>
                <uib-accordion-group heading="What is an ad handover?">
                  When a company chooses an ad, the creator of that ad will immediately be notified and paid. After the transaction has been successful, the creator of that ad automatically transfers the rights to use that ad (both the photo and the copy). Only the winning ad goes through an ad handover, and if your ad wasn't chosen this time, you keep all rights to your ad.

                </uib-accordion-group>
                <uib-accordion-group heading="What does the number 30 mean?">
                  All campaigns are capped at 30 ads. This keeps the chances of your ad being tapped high, and anymore ads than that isn't as easy on the eyes.
                </uib-accordion-group>
                <uib-accordion-group heading="How many campaigns can I create ads for?">
                  Create ads for as many campaigns that interest you! We've had users get paid for more multiple campaigns in a week, so we recommend that you create ads for all of them.
                </uib-accordion-group>
                <uib-accordion-group heading="How many times can I get tapped?">
                 That depends on how good you are :D There's no limit on how many campaigns you can win!
                </uib-accordion-group>
                <uib-accordion-group heading="What if a company doesn't choose an ad?">
                 If a campaign ends, and a company decides to not purchase at least one ad, Tappyn will personally purchase the ad with the most likes. Be sure to share your ad, so your friends and family can like it!

             <uib-accordion-group heading="What is a payout and how do I request one?">
             When your ad is tapped by a company, you'll be instantly notified, and you'll be paid $85 by that company. You can claim your winnings either through our secure Stripe system in your account or via PayPal. It's as easy as that!
            </uib-accordion-group>
            <uib-accordion-group heading="What payment methods are available?">
             Stripe secure payments is 100% safe and is integrated into your account! Just input your account info, and your winnings can be directly deposited into the account of your choosing. If you’re an international user or would prefer to not use our integrated system, just contact us through squad@tappyn.com or on the website, and we’ll arrange a PayPal payout method.
            </uib-accordion-group>
            <uib-accordion-group heading="How do I know I'll get paid?">
              A winner is guaranteed for every campaign! On the off chance that a company doesn’t choose a winning ad within 3 days, the submission with the most votes will recieve the $85 payout, so it’s important to make sure you're submitting an awesome ad that other members of Tappyn will praise.

            <uib-accordion-group heading="When do I sign the Copyright Transfer Agreement?">
              If you're like us, we’re not a fan of paperwork, so we’ve saved you some time and have included it in our Terms of Service that every member must agree to during the sign up process.

            <uib-accordion class='faqpayment'>
             <uib-accordion-group heading="Do I have to own the photos that I submit to campaigns?">
                Absolutely. If you create an ad with a photo that you don't own the rights to (this includes stock photos and free for use photos), your ad will be removed, and you'll receive an infringement warning. If a partner of Tappyn keeps submitted un-original photos, their account will be suspended. You must have ownership of all content that you submit to contests.
                </uib-accordion-group>
                <uib-accordion-group heading="Do I need professional photographs to win?">
                Not at all! Many campaigns actually choose ads that are the most relatable to an audience and most relevant to the company hosting the campaign. High quality images are recommended, but you don't need to be a professional photographer to win. Also, photos are only one part of the complete ad. A clever head line can go a long way!
                </uib-accordion-group>
                <uib-accordion-group heading="What kind of photos can I submit with an ad?">
                As long as it's your own work, be as creative as you want! Selfies, landscapes, animals, sports, etc. You name it. Try to tailor your photo to the company that launched the contest by reading their informational breif, and include a picture of the product/app if available to increase your chances of winning.
                </uib-accordion-group>
                <uib-accordion-group heading="What kind of photos am I not allowed to submit with an ad?">
                You may not post violent, nude, partially nude, discriminatory, unlawful, infringing, hateful, pornographic or sexually suggestive photos. Content that falls under these categories will be removed, and the account owner will be suspended.
                </uib-accordion-group>
                <uib-accordion-group heading="Will other users be able to see my photos that I submit?">
                Yup, everyone's submissions are viewable in that campaign's submission feed. There's no need to be shy though. All types of creativity is encouraged here at Tappyn, and chances are that other users are going to love what you create!
