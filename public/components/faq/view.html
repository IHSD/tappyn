              Campaigns are hosted by cool, new companies willing to pay an immediate $85 for a digital ad created by you. They are capped at 30 ad submissions and end after 7 days or if they reach their cap limit. At the close of the campaign, the hosting company chooses its favorite ad, and the creator of that winning ad is instantly paid. Other members of Tappyn can up-vote your submission, bringing it to the top of the campaign feed for the company to see. Submit to as many campaigns as you'd like!

                  On the left side of every campaign, an informational ad brief can be found which gives you important insight into creating the right ad. Personalized ads are almost always tapped before generic ads, so be sure to read about the company and what makes them different. Also, pay special attention to what they are looking for in an ad. Companies often explain in detail what type of ad they are more likely to love. It also won't hurt to check out their website, which is linked in the brief, to get a comprehensive sense of their branding. Remember, personalized ads almost always get tapped!
