			<h2>Terms of Service</h2>
			<p>Certain features of the Services or Site may be subject to additional guidelines, terms, or rules, which will be posted on the Service or Site in connection with such features. To the extent such terms, guidelines, and rules conflict with these terms of use, these terms of use shall govern.</p>
		<p><strong>These terms of use (&ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) set forth the legally binding terms for your use of the Site and Services (whether as a Customer or as a Writer). By registering for Services, you are accepting this Agreement and you represent and warrant that you have the right, authority, and capacity to enter into this Agreement. You may not access or use the Site or Services if you are not at least 18 years old. If you do not agree with all of the provisions of this Agreement, you cannot use the Services.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>In case you are located in the United States this Agreement requires the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or class actions, and also limits the remedies available to you in the event of a dispute.</strong></p>
		<ol>
		<li>Service</li>
		</ol>
		<p>1.1 General.</p>
		<p>Fabel provides an online platform that helps connect customers who wish to purchase copys (&ldquo;<strong>Customers</strong>&rdquo;) and writers who wish to provide such copys (&ldquo;<strong>Writers</strong>&rdquo;), including, for example, through Copy Contests, the Ready-made Copy Store, the Project Service, and Tasks (each as defined below and collectively, the &ldquo;<strong>Services</strong>&rdquo;). &ldquo;<strong>User</strong>&rdquo; means any user of the Site or Service, and may be a Writer or a Customer. If you are a User, the provisions in this Agreement regarding Users apply to you. If you are also a Customer, further the provisions in this Agreement regarding Customers apply to you. If you are also a Writer, further the provisions in this Agreement regarding Writers apply to you. &ldquo;<strong>Sold Copy</strong>&rdquo; means the applicable winning Copy Concept, purchased Copy Template (and any customized version thereof), or the copy sold under the Project Service. &ldquo;<strong>Sale</strong>&rdquo; means the applicable sale. &ldquo;<strong>IPR</strong>&rdquo; means all trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, mask work rights, patents and other intellectual property rights recognized by the laws of any country.</p>
		<p>1.2 Copy Contest.</p>
		<p><strong>(a)</strong>&nbsp;Customer may create a copy contest (&ldquo;<strong>Copy Contest</strong>&rdquo;) by creating a copy brief (&ldquo;<strong>Copy Brief</strong>&rdquo;), paying the Customer Payment and following the other instructions on the Site. The Copy Brief must clearly specify the requirements for the Copy Contest, such that Writers clearly know the rules and criteria on which their Copy Concepts will be judged. There are currently two types of Copy Contests: (1) the default Pre-Paid Contest and (2) the Guaranteed Contest. Writers invited by Fabel (in Fabel&rsquo; sole discretion) to enter a Copy Contest may submit copy concepts (&ldquo;<strong>Copy Concepts</strong>&rdquo;) in the format specified by Fabel by following the instructions on the Site. Copy Concepts must comply with the Copy Brief.&nbsp;<strong>(b)</strong>&nbsp;For Guaranteed Contests, Customer must select one or more winning Copy Concepts by a certain time specified by Fabel. If no winner is selected in the qualifying round of a Guaranteed Contest, Fabel will retain the Customer Payment, Fabel will distribute the Writer Fee equally among the Writers who participated in the Guaranteed Contest and who have won a Copy Contest in the past and who have not breached this Agreement, and Customer will have no right to a refund or to use the Copy Concepts. If no winner is selected in the final round of a Guaranteed Contest, Fabel will retain the Customer Payment, Fabel will distribute the Writer Fee equally among the finalists who satisfy criteria determined by Fabel&rsquo; in its sole discretion, in the final round of the Guaranteed Contest, and Customer will have no right to a refund or to use the Copy Concepts.&nbsp;<strong>(c)</strong>&nbsp;For Pre-Paid Contests, Customer must select one or more winning Copy Concepts by the time the Pre-Paid Contest closes. Customer may withdraw Pre-Paid Contest (but not a Guaranteed Contest) for a refund of the Customer Payment before entering the final round and before the close of the Pre-Paid Contest. Customer may additionally seek a refund of the Customer Payment for a Pre-Paid Contest (but not a Guaranteed Contest) at any time up to 60 days after the date of payment for the Pre-Paid Contest, but only if finalists were not chosen by Customer.&nbsp;<strong>(d)</strong>&nbsp;For the avoidance of doubt, Customer has no right or license to use any Copy Concepts other than the Sold Copy. Customer may not: (a) run a Copy Contest if Customer is tendering the creation of the same copy through a service other than the Site (this Section (a) does not apply to customers located in the EEA); (b) allow or request Writers to submit Copy Concepts to Customer via any means other than via the Site; and (c) collude in relation to the awarding of a winner in a Copy Contest or awarding a separate account held by Customer as the successful Writer in a Copy Contest. Customers and Writers must deal on an arm&rsquo;s length basis&nbsp;<strong>Customer may not cancel any Copy Contest for the purpose of contracting separately with a Writer who Customer meets through the Site which results in Customer avoiding paying Fabel any Customer Payment or any fees and charges of Fabel.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(e)</strong>&nbsp;Some jurisdictions provide Customer certain mandatory statutory rights (e.g., right to supplementary performance (e.g., rectification or replacement), right for a refund, right to withdrawal, right to reduce the price and right to damages in case the Copy Concepts are defective) (collectively, &ldquo;<strong>Mandatory Statutory Rights</strong>&rdquo;) which remain unaffected.</p>
		<p>1.3 Ready-made Copy Store.</p>
		<p><strong>(a)</strong>&nbsp;Writers may list copy templates (&ldquo;<strong>Copy Templates</strong>&rdquo;) for sale in 99copy&rsquo;s Ready-made Copy Store (&ldquo;<strong>Ready-made Copy Store</strong>&rdquo;), by creating a listing, uploading the Copy Template (in the file format specified by Fabel), and following the instructions on the Site. Fabel reserves the right to modify and/or remove any Copy Templates in its sole non-discriminatory discretion (including any Copy Template similar to other Copy Templates on the Site or other websites, or does not meet Fabel quality standards). Fabel will set and may modify the selling price of any Copy Template. If Writer does not agree with any modifications or pricing, then Writer may remove the Copy Template from the Ready-made Copy Store. During the time a Copy Template is listed for sale in the Ready-made Copy Store, Writer hereby grants Fabel the exclusive right to market and sell the Copy Template (and copys based on the Copy Template) and will not market or sell the Copy Template (or copys based on the Copy Template) other than through the Site.&nbsp;<strong>(b)</strong>&nbsp;Once a Customer purchases a Copy Template, Customer may request (in which case the Writer must provide) up to two rounds of customizations to the Copy Template for the purposes of inserting Customer&rsquo;s brand name or making minor customizations to the Copy Template itself. Writer may refuse to make customizations which are in addition to the forgoing. Writer must deliver each required round of customizations to Customer within 24 hours after receiving Customer&rsquo;s requests, otherwise Fabel may (upon Customer&rsquo;s request and in Fabel&rsquo; discretion) cancel the sale of the Copy Template to the Customer or perform the customizations itself or through its subcontractors, in which case, Writer will forfeit 30% of the Writer Fee for such sale (or a lesser amount if required under applicable law for customers located in the EEA). Customer will be deemed to have accepted the resulting copy unless the copy does not include the requested customizations and Customer provides notice of rejection to Fabel and Writer within 48 hours of delivery of the copy. If the cause for the notice of rejection is not cured within 30 days of the notice of rejection (and for customers located in the EEA you&rsquo;ve exhausted your Mandatory Statutory Rights), Customer will be refunded the Customer Payment and Customer will have no right to use the Copy Template or resulting copy in any way. If Fabel determines, in its sole and absolute discretion that a delivered Copy Template (including customizations made by the Writer) complied with the requirements of this Section 1.3 and Customer&rsquo;s rejection was therefore unwarranted, then Fabel may determine that the Copy Template and resulting copy is instead accepted by Customer and such determination is final and conclusive.&nbsp;<strong>(c)</strong>Some jurisdictions provide Customer certain Mandatory Statutory Rights (defined in Section 1.2(e) above) which remain unaffected.</p>
		<p>1.4 Project Service.</p>
		<p><strong>(a)</strong>&nbsp;Customers and Writers can work with each other on copy projects by creating a 1-to-1 project (&ldquo;Project Service&rdquo;) and following the directions on the Site. Writer can create invoices to request payments from Customer. Customer can pay invoices and reserve the right to accept copys before they are considered Sold Copys. If copys have not been accepted by Customer, Customer may request a refund of the Customer Payment, at any time up to 60 days after the date of invoice payment, or 10 days after delivery of Copys, whichever happens sooner. In addition to the foregoing, customers located in the EEA may request a refund of the Customer Payment, at any time up to one year starting with the accrual of the claim. After Writer has delivered the copys, Customer will be deemed to have accepted the copys unless Customer provides notice of rejection to Fabel and Writer within 10 days of delivery of the copys. If the cause for the notice of rejection is not cured within 30 days of a rejection notice, Customer will be refunded the Customer Payment and Customer will have no right to use the resulting copy in any way. Fabel reserves the right in its sole discretion to restrict Customers or Writers from creating projects using Project Services and to remove projects. Fabel has no involvement in managing or providing the copy to Customer and is simply providing the ability for Writer to store files for, work with, invoice and receive payments from Customers, and for Customers to request services from, view copys, provide feedback on projects and pay Writers, using Project Services.&nbsp;<strong>(b)</strong>&nbsp;Some jurisdictions provide Customer certain Mandatory Statutory Rights (defined in Section 1.2(e) above) which remain unaffected.</p>
		<p>1.5 Tasks.</p>
		<p><strong>(a)</strong>&nbsp;The Marketplace. We provide a marketplace (&ldquo;Marketplace&rdquo;) where Customers can submit to Writers, for a fee, simple and swift-to-complete copy projects (Tasks). An appropriate Task, by way of example, might be to resize an image to a specified number of pixels across, while preserving its aspect ratio, or to change the color temperature of an image to make it warmer or cooler, or to create a clipping path of an object in a photo.</p>
		<p><strong>(b)</strong>&nbsp;Customer Payments for Tasks. Prior to submitting a Task, Customers shall prepay for one or more Tasks. Customer Payments for Tasks may be prepaid in bulk quantities and any prepaid but unused amounts shall become Task credits to be applied to future Task submittals. Customer Payments for Tasks shall be in U.S. dollars unless a local currency option is offered by us.</p>
		<p><strong>(c)</strong>&nbsp;Task Submittal. If you submit a Task to the Marketplace you automatically become a Customer. Once you submit a Task to our Marketplace, it remains there until it is claimed by a Writer or is removed by Customer Service as set forth below. The Writer who completes the Task provides the completed copy to the Customer (&ldquo;Task Delivery&rdquo;) and all legal rights to it.</p>
		<p>(i) Required Information. Each Task should consist of (A) a detailed description of the Task and (B) electronic files, if any, required for a Writer to complete the Task (together these are considered User Content). (ii) Representation Regarding Right to Submit. By submitting a Task to the Marketplace, a Customer represents that Customer owns the User Content or otherwise has the right to submit User Content to us, and Customer's use of the User Content does not violate any third party intellectual property or other rights.</p>
		<p><strong>(d)</strong>&nbsp;Task Claim by Writer. We will monitor the Marketplace to ensure that every Task is claimed by a Writer in a timely manner. Tasks which aren&rsquo;t claimed by a Writer within a reasonable amount of time, as determined by us in our discretion, will be removed from the Marketplace and sent to Customer Service for review. A Customer Service representative will contact the Customer who submitted such Task to suggest changes which will increase the likelihood that a Writer will claim the Task.</p>
		<p>(i) Inventory. Writers are expected to promptly claim or skip Tasks, so that Tasks can be quickly completed for Customers. (ii) When to Skip a Task. Tasks that are skipped frequently will be removed from the Marketplace and reviewed by Customer Service. Generally, a Writer should not skip a Task unless (A) such Writer does not have the necessary skills to complete such Task, or (B) the User Content provided does not constitute a Task because (1) not enough information is provided to enable the Writer to complete the Task or the information provided is not sufficiently clear, or (2) the Task would require more than 30 minutes of Writer's time. (iii) Inactivity Penalty. The Marketplace works only if the engagement by the Writers matches or exceeds the activity by the Customers. If Tasks are not claimed or skipped by Writers promptly, we reserve the right, in our discretion, to penalize the Writers as a group, by offering a lower service fee for each completed Task. The lower service fee will stay in effect until a satisfactory Task claim rate by Writers is restored, as determined in our discretion, at which time we will lift the penalty.</p>
		<p><strong>(e)</strong>&nbsp;Task Completion. Each Writer agrees to use such Writer's best professional and creative efforts and skills to complete each Task claimed by such Writer.</p>
		<p>(i) Time to Complete the Task. After a Writer claims a Task, such Writer will have one hour to complete it. (ii) Tasks Not Completed On Time. A Task that is not completed within the timeframe specified on the Site will automatically return to the Marketplace and Writer will not be credited for the work done on such Task.</p>
		<p><strong>(f)</strong>&nbsp;Task Customer Delivery. When a Writer completes a Task, such Writer will upload the Task Delivery to the Site.</p>
		<p>(i) Representation Regarding Right to Submit. By providing Delivery to the Customer, Writer represents that Writer has the right to provide Delivery to Customer, and Customer's use of the Task Delivery will not, to Writer's knowledge, violate any third party intellectual property or other rights. (ii) Ownership of Task Delivery. Writer assigns to Customer all rights to Task Delivery. (iii) Grant of Limited Rights to Us. Each Writer authorizes us to retain archival copies of all Delivery that such Writer has created and to use such Task Delivery in connection with the Site and our business, including for promoting the Site in any media format and through any media channel.</p>
		<p><strong>(g)</strong>&nbsp;Customer Task Acceptance. When a Task is complete, the Customer who submitted it will receive an email from us with a link to download the Task Delivery. A Task is considered &ldquo;accepted&rdquo; by the Customer (i) when the Customer clicks on the "Approve" button, (ii) if it is not declined by the Customer within 72 hours after notification of the Task Delivery, or (iii) if it is deemed accepted by Customer Service in each case as set forth in Section 2(d).</p>
		<p><strong>(h)</strong>&nbsp;Writer Payment. A Writer is only paid if and when Task Delivery is accepted by Customer. When a Customer accepts Task Delivery from a Writer, Writer's Fabel Account is credited with the copy fee pursuant to Section 3.3.</p>
		<p><strong>(i)</strong>&nbsp;Task Delivery Disputes.</p>
		<p>(i) Resolution with Writer. If a Customer is not satisfied with the Task Delivery, within 72 hours after notification of the Delivery is sent to the Customer, and the Customer has not clicked the "Approve" button, the Customer may decline the Task Delivery and it will be returned to the Writer for revision. The Writer will attempt to make modifications to make the Task Delivery fit Customer's reasonable expectations. The Writer will resubmit the revised Task Delivery within the timeframe specified on the Site. A revised Task Delivery that is not declined by Customer within 72 hours after being resubmitted will be considered accepted by Customer. (ii) Customer Service Intervention. If a Customer is still not satisfied with the revised Task Delivery, Customer may contact Customer Service. Customer Service will review the Task specifications, the Task Delivery and Customer's claims. (A) If Customer Service determines that Writer had failed to follow Task specifications, Customer will be deemed not to have accepted the Task Delivery, and Customer will have another opportunity to submit the Task to the Marketplace. (B) If Customer Service determines that either (1) Customer's demands with respect to Task Delivery are not reasonable given the Task specification, (2) Customer is being actively malicious, (3) Customer has not provided enough guidance, direction, or instruction to the Writer resulting in the need for multiple edits, or (4) Customer's Task was too complex or time-consuming to constitute a Task, the Customer will be deemed to have accepted the Task Delivery, and will be charged the Fee (or be ineligible for a refund if prepaid).</p>
		<ol start="2">
		<li>Copy Transfer Agreement.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The Copy Transfer Agreement, available upon request, sets forth the legally binding terms between the applicable Writer and Customer for the sale of a Sold Copy through the Copy Contest or Ready-made Copy Store. The Copy Transfer Agreement sets forth the legally binding terms between the applicable Writer and Customer for the sale of a Sold Copy through the Project Service.</p>
		<ol start="3">
		<li>Payment Terms.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The following terms apply to Customers who have purchased a Sold Copy and Writers who have sold a Sold Copy.</p>
		<p>3.1 Payment and Delivery.</p>
		<p>For the Copy Contest and Ready-made Copy Store, (a) Customer will pay the Customer Payment to Fabel and Fabel will pay Writer the Writer Fee (subject to first receiving payment from Customer), and (b) Writer will upload the Sold Copy and Fabel will deliver the Sold Copy to Customer, in a format specified by Fabel. For the Project Services, (1) Writer will upload the Copy and if Customer accepts the Copy as described above, then (2) Customer will pay the Customer Payment and Fabel will pay Writer the Writer Fee (subject to first receiving payment from Customer). The &ldquo;<strong>Customer Payment</strong>&rdquo; means (i) the price selected by Customer when Customer created a Copy Contest as set forth at http://Fabel.com/pricing; or (ii) the listed price for the Sold Copy in the Ready-made Copy Store; or (iii) the invoiced price for the Sold Copy issued through the Project Service by Writer to Customer. The &ldquo;<strong>Writer Fee</strong>&rdquo; means the Customer Payment, minus the fees and charges imposed by Fabel as set forth at&nbsp;<a href="http://help.99designs.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1554727-how-much-does-1-to-1-projects-cost">http://help.Fabel.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1554727-how-much-does-1-to-1-projects-cost</a>&nbsp;and minus any applicable Taxes.</p>
		<p>3.2 Refunds.</p>
		<p>Refunds will be paid to Customer using the same payment methods Customer used to remit the Customer Payment to Fabel or via any other method specified by Fabel from time to time. If a refund is paid to Customer or a credit card charge back occurs, then: (a) Writer must reimburse Fabel for the applicable Writer Fee (the reimbursement will first be paid out of any Fabel Credits held by Writer and any remaining debt will be payable by Writer to Fabel on demand); and (b) Customer will initially receive the amount of the Customer Payment, less the Writer Fee and will receive the Writer Fee only once the Writer Fee is reimbursed by Writer to Fabel. Fabel may refund Customers for the following reasons: (i) the Sold Copy is Defective; (ii) Fabel is required by law or considers that it is required by law to do so; (iii) Fabel determines that issuing a refund to Customer will avoid any dispute or increased costs to Fabel; (iv) Fabel issues the refund to Customer in accordance with any refund policy specified by Fabel from time to time; (v) the order placed (or request made) by Customer is found to be fraudulent; (vi) Customer placed a duplicate order (or request) in error; or (vii) in Fabel&rsquo; sole opinion, Fabel considers that it is likely that the refund is necessary to avoid a credit card charge back. A Sold Copy will be deemed to be &ldquo;<strong>Defective</strong>&rdquo; if: (i) Customer and Writer agree it is defective and notify Fabel of this fact; (ii) the Sold Copy is subject to a third party claim that the Sold Copy infringes/misappropriates such party&rsquo;s IPR, that is not frivolous.</p>
		<p>3.3 Fabel Credits.</p>Fabel
		<p><strong>(a)</strong>&nbsp;The Writer Fee will be paid to Writer in Fabel Credits. There are two types of Fabel Credits: (i) Currency Credits, which are equivalent to one unit of the local currency based on the location of the Site (e.g., if you are using the U.S. site, the Currency Credit would be equivalent to U.S. $1; if you are using the German site, the Currency Credit would be equivalent to 1Euro; etc.); and (ii) Bonus Credits, which are not equivalent to any currency. Fabel Credits are not legal tender and cannot be traded or sold to third parties. Fabel Credits are only exchangeable for Sold Copys. The balance of any Fabel Credits held by you may be reduced at any time by Fabel for charge-backs or refunds, or for any amount owing by you to Fabel, to compensate Fabel for any loss it has suffered as a result of any breach of this Agreement by you. Provided that you are not in breach of this Agreement and your Account is not suspended, you may at any time (and Fabel may require you to at any time) convert Currency Credits which you hold in your Account to U.S. dollars or any other currency specified by Fabel from time to time. Any such payments will be subject to any minimum or maximum withdrawal amounts set by Fabel, to address, for example, charge-backs and refunds. Fabel is not an escrow service and does not hold property on behalf of any person. All amounts deposited or paid to Fabel are property of Fabel and Fabel may use those funds as it sees fit. The only rights that you have to receive payment of any amounts held by Fabel are as set out in this Section 3.3. Upon termination of this Agreement, all Bonus Credits will be cancelled immediately and you may convert Currency Credits described above.</p>
		<p>3.4 General Payment Terms.</p>
		<p>All payment will be in the local currency based on the location of the Site. You agree that you are responsible for the collection and/or payment of all Taxes which you may be liable for in any jurisdiction arising from your sale or purchase of any Sold Copys via the Site. Fabel is not responsible for collecting, reporting, paying, or remitting to you any such Taxes. &ldquo;<strong>Taxes</strong>&rdquo; means any applicable duties, sales taxes, GST, VAT or other taxes which may be levied in respect of a transaction contemplated by this Agreement.</p>
		<ol start="4">
		<li>Exclusivity and Non-Circumvention.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>4.1 Exclusivity.</p>
		<p>You acknowledge and agree that a substantial portion of the compensation Fabel receives for making the Site available to you is collected as fees deducted from the Customer Payment which is only deducted when a Customer and Writer pay and receive payment through the Site. Therefore, for 24 months from the time you meet any party through the Site (the "Exclusivity Period"), you must use the Fabel Services as your exclusive method to request, make, and receive all payments for work directly or indirectly with that party or arising out of your relationship with that party (the "Fabel Relationship"). You may opt-out of this obligation only if Customer or prospective Customer pays Fabel an "Opt-Out Fee" computed to be the greater of the following amounts:</p>
		<p><strong>(a)</strong>&nbsp;$2,500; or</p>
		<p><strong>(b)</strong>&nbsp;15% of the cost to the Customer of the services to be performed in the Fabel Relationship during the Exclusivity Period, as estimated in good faith by the prospective Customer.</p>
		<p>To pay the Opt-Out Fee, you must request instructions by sending an email message to support@Fabel.com.</p>
		<p>4.2 Non-Circumvention.</p>
		<p>You agree not to circumvent the payment methods offered by the Site. By way of illustration and not in limitation of the foregoing, you must not:</p>
		<p><strong>(a)</strong>&nbsp;Submit proposals or solicit parties identified through the Site to contact, hire, manage, or pay outside the Site.</p>
		<p><strong>(b)</strong>&nbsp;Accept proposals or solicit parties identified through the Site to contact, deliver services, invoice, or receive payment outside the Site.</p>
		<p><strong>(c)</strong>&nbsp;Cancel any Copy Contest for the purpose of contracting separately with a Writer who Customer meets through the Site.</p>
		<p><strong>(d)</strong>&nbsp;Invoice or report on the Site or in an Opt-Out Fee request an invoice or payment amount lower than that actually agreed between Client and Writer.</p>
		<p>You agree to notify Fabel immediately if another person improperly contacts you or suggests making or receiving payments outside of the Site. If you are aware of a breach or potential breach of this non-circumvention policy, please submit a confidential report to us by sending an email message to: support@Fabel.com.</p>
		<ol start="5">
		<li>Important Disclaimers and Release</li>

This Section 5.2 does not apply to customers located in the EEA.</p>
		<p><strong>If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542 in connection with the foregoing, which states: &ldquo;a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.&rdquo;</strong></p>
		<ol start="6">
		<li>Accounts.</li>

You represent and warrant that: (a) all required registration information you submit is truthful and accurate; and (b) you will maintain the accuracy of such information. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you agree to provide Fabel with identification documents (including copies of IDs, passports or drivers licenses) which Fabel requests from you from time to time for the purposes of verifying your identity.

		<ol start="7">
		<li>User Content.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>7.1 Your User Content.</p>
		<p><strong>&ldquo;User Content&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;means any and all information and content that a User submits to, or uses with, the Site or Services. User Content includes Copy Contests, Copy Concepts, Copy Templates, and reviews and/or testimonials (&ldquo;Reviews&rdquo;). You are solely responsible for your User Content. You assume all risks associated with use of your User Content, including any reliance on its accuracy, completeness or usefulness by others, or any disclosure of your User Content that makes you or any third party personally identifiable. You hereby represent and warrant that your User Content does not violate the Acceptable Use Policy (defined below). You may not state or imply that your User Content is in any way provided, sponsored or endorsed by Fabel. Because you alone are responsible for your User Content (and not Fabel), you may expose yourself to liability if, for example, your User Content violates the Acceptable Use Policy. Fabel is not obligated to remove any Copy Contests, Copy Concepts, Copy Templates, or Reviews from the Site unless required by applicable Law. Fabel is not obligated to backup any User Content and User Content may be deleted at any time. You are solely responsible for creating backup copies of your User Content if you desire.</p>
		<p>7.2 License to User Content.</p>
		<p>You hereby grant, and you represent and warrant, that you have the right to grant, to Fabel an irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free and fully paid, worldwide license for all the duration of the intellectual property rights to reproduce, distribute, publicly display and perform, prepare derivative works of, incorporate into other works, and otherwise use your User Content, and to grant sublicenses of the foregoing, solely for the purposes of including your User Content in the Site and Services; provided that Fabel will only use your Copy Brief and Copy Concepts to run the applicable Copy Contest in accordance with the private or public settings of the Copy Contest. You agree to irrevocably waive (and cause to be waived) any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to your User Content (this sentence does not apply to customers located in the EEA). For the avoidance of doubt, Writer&rsquo;s license or assignment of the Sold Copy to Customer is set forth in the applicable Copy Transfer Agreement.</p>

		<li>Disclaimers.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>13.1</p>
		<p><strong>The Site and Services are provided &ldquo;AS-IS&rdquo; and &ldquo;AS AVAILABLE&rdquo; and we (and our suppliers) expressly disclaim any warranties and conditions of any kind, whether express or implied, including the warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, quiet enjoyment, accuracy, or non-infringement. We (and our suppliers) make no warranty that the Site or Services: (a) will meet your requirements; (b) will be available on an uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free basis; or (c) will be accurate, reliable, free of viruses or other harmful code, complete, legal, or safe.

		<p>13.2</p>
		<p>The following Section applies to users in the EEA and Switzerland: Fabel is liable for defects in accordance with the applicable statutory provisions. With regard to companies, the warranty period is limited to twelve (12) months. An additional warranty is only provided if this has been expressly agreed.**</p>

		<li>Limitation on Liability.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>14.1</p>
		<p>In no event shall we (and our suppliers) be liable to you or any third party for any lost profit or any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special or punitive damages arising from or relating to this Agreement or your use of, or inability to use, the Site or Services, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Access to, and use of, the Site and Services are at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data resulting therefrom. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, our (and our suppliers&rsquo;) liability to you for any damages arising from or related to this Agreement (for any cause whatsoever and regardless of the form of the action), will at all times be limited to the greater of (a) fifty us dollars ($50) or (b) amounts you have paid Fabel in the prior 12 months (if any). The existence of more than one claim will not enlarge this limit. Some states do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental of consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you and you may also have other legal rights that vary from state to state.**</p>
		<ol start="15">
		<li>General.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>15.1 Changes to Terms of Use.</p>
		<p>This Agreement (including pricing terms) is subject to occasional revision, and if we make any substantial changes, we may notify you by sending you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us (if any) and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our Site. Any changes to this agreement will be effective upon the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you (if applicable) or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on our Site. These changes will be effective immediately for new users of our Site or Services. You are responsible for providing us with your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail address that you have provided us is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in the notice. Continued use of our Site or Services following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.</p>
		<p>15.2 Entire Agreement.</p>
		<p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Site and Services. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word including means including without limitation. If any provision of this Agreement is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Your relationship to Fabel is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. This Agreement, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Fabel&rsquo; prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon assignees.</p>
